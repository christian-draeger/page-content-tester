**this is the parent pom for optional use on Paco Test projects.**

When using the parent pom it will automatically pull all necessary dependencies
into your test project and setup the parallel test execution for you.

If you don't use the page-content-tester parent pom it is recommended to
configure surefire for parallel execution.
